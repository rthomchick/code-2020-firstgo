## About This Book
The VMware Storage Policy Programming Guide describes how to use the VMwareÂ® Storage Policy API.

The VMware Storage Policy SDK supports the development of vCenter clients that use storage profiles for virtual machine configuration. This method of storage administration is called storage policy based management (SPBM).

To view the current version of this book as well as all VMware API and SDK documentation, go to http://code.vmware.com/sdks and click vSphere Management SDK.

### Revision History
This book is revised with each release of the product or when necessary. The following table summarizes significant changes in each version of this book.

### Intended Audience
This book is intended for anyone who needs to develop applications using the VMware Storage Policy SDK. An understanding of Web Services technology and some programming background in Java is required.

### Sample Code
The VMware Storage Policy SDK includes Java programs to list storage profiles, view a specific profile, create a new storage profile, associate a storage profile with a VM (when creating, cloning, or relocating the VM), check compliance of the VM with its storage profile, and delete a storage profile.

### API Reference
Many of the SPBM interfaces start with the letters Pbm, for policy based management. To find an API reference information, go to https://code.vmware.com/sdksand click vSphere Management SDK then click VMware Storage Policy API Reference. There are Pbm interfaces in all categories: managed objects, data objects, enumerated types, fault types, methods, and so forth.
