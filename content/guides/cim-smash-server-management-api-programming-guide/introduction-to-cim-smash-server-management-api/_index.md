VMware ESXi includes a CIM Object Manager (CIMOM) that implements a set of server discovery and monitoring features that are compatible with the SMASH standard. With the VMware CIM SMASH/Server Management API, clients that use industry-standard protocols can do the following:

- Enumerate system resources
- Monitor system health data
- Upgrade installed software

The VMware implementation of the SMASH standard uses the open-source implementation of the Open Management with CIM (OMC) project. OMC provides tools and software infrastructure for hardware vendors and others who require a reliable implementation of the Distributed Management Task Force (DMTF) management profiles.
