If you have trouble with connections between a CIM client and a CIM server, or between a CIM server and a process that consumes indications, you can try to diagnose and correct the trouble using this information.

This material is organized into two sections. One section applies to connections initiated by the client. The other section applies to connections initiated by the server when delivering indications.

- See Connections from Client to CIM Server if your CIM client is unable to connect to the CIM server.
- See Connections from CIM Server to Indication Consumer if your CIM client is able to connect to the CIM server and subscribe to indications, but the indications are not delivered.
