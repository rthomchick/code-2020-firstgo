A basic CIM client that allows you to connect to a CIM server can be outlined as several steps that build on prior steps. Each step is explained and illustrated with pseudocode. You can expand this outline to create clients that allow you to manage the server.

The CIM client outline presented in this chapter shows a recommended general approach to accessing the CIM objects from the Interop namespace. This approach assumes no advance knowledge of the specifics of the CIM implementation. If your client is aware of items such as the Service URL and the namespaces used in the VMware implementation, see Using the CIM Object Space for more information about accessing specific objects in the Implementation namespace.
