Virtual machine configuration and virtual disk data reside in datastores.

Virtual machine configuration is stored in a file with the . vmx file extension. VM home files also include other files for virtual machine operation, such as a log file (. log), virtual firmware (. nvram), paging file (. vmem), and snapshot data files (. vmsd).

Virtual machine data is stored in virtual disks, in files with the . vmdk file extension.

Storage policies allow you to distinguish between virtual machine configuration and data files and to specify storage locations based on the needs of each.
