Storage requirements are based on storage capabilities available from storage provider, and vSphere offers vSAN storage capabilities. To create a requirements profile for vSAN capabilities, you retrieve metadata that describes vSAN capabilities and create a subprofile that expresses the storage requirements for virtual machine or virtual disk files. To perform these operations, you connect to the Storage Policy Server.
