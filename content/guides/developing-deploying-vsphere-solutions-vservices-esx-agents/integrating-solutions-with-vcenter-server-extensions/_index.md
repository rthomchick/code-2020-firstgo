You can integrate a vCenter Server extension with the vCenter Server Extensions by implementing certain data objects and properties from the vSphere Management SDK.

vCenter Server Extensions is the principal location in the vSphere Web Client where a vSphere administrator can find information about the solutions that are running in vCenter Server. vCenter Server Extensions displays the name and version of the solution.

Register with vCenter Server Extensions all of the solutions that you develop. Typically, you create at least one tab to configure and monitor a solution. Solution configuration tasks to perform in a configuration tab include setting up the solution, specifying any database connections, and setting logging levels.
