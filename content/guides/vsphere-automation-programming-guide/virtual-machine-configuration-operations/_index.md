A virtual machine is a software computer that, like a physical computer, runs an operating system and applications. The virtual machine consists of a set of specification and configuration files and is backed by the physical resources of a host. Each virtual machine encapsulates a complete computing environment and runs independently of the underlying hardware.

Starting with vSphere 6.5, you can configure virtual machine settings and perform power operations through the vSphere Automation SDKs .
