The Content Library Service provides means for managing content libraries in the context of a single or multiple vCenter Server instances deployed in your virtual environment. You can use the vSphere Automation APIs to access the Content Library Service through the vSphere Automation Endpoint.

Administrators can use content libraries to share VM templates, vApp templates, and other types of files across vCenter Server instances in the virtual environment. Sharing templates across your virtual environment promotes consistency, compliance, efficiency, and automation in deploying workloads at scale.
