## Overview
The vSphere Automation SDKs bundle client libraries for accessing new vSphere Automation features like Content Library and existing features like Tagging. The vSphere Automation SDKs contain sample applications and API reference documentation for the Content Library and Tagging services. The vSphere Automation SDKs also provide sample code that retrieves the endpoints of vSphere Automation and vSphere services and establishes a secure connection with the vSphere Automation endpoint.

vSphere Automation supports five languages for accessing the vSphere Automation API services and provides five SDKs for developing client applications for managing components in your virtual environment.
