The vSphere Client is a Web browser-based application that provides an extensible plug-in architecture. The user interface layer contains every visual component of the application, including data views, portlets, and navigation controls.

You can add UI features by creating user interface extensions. A UI plug-in contains one or more extensions, which add UI elements to the vSphere Client user interface.
