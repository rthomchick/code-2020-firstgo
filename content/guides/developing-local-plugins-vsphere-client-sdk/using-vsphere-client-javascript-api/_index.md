The vSphere Client provides several interfaces that your plug-in can use to communicate with the HTML5 platform. These JavaScript methods are documented here as if they have TypeScript signatures, but they run as pure JavaScript, and all complex types are plain old Javascript objects.

Each plug-in runs in an iframe that has the same origin as the vSphere Client.
