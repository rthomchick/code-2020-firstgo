##About This Book
The book Developing Local Plug-ins with the vSphere Client SDK provides information about developing, deploying and troubleshooting HTML-5 extensions to the vSphere Client user interface.

VMware provides many APIs and SDKs for different applications and goals. This documentation provides information about the extensibility framework of the vSphere Client for developers who are interested in extending the Web application with custom functionality using an HTML-5 user interface.

The information in this book will help you to develop local plug-ins for the vSphere Client. VMware continues to support local plug-ins, which have back ends running as services within the vSphere Client application server. However, for new plug-in development VMware recommends remote plug-ins, which offer superior functional and performance advantages. For more information about remote plug-ins, see the companion book Developing Remote Plug-ins with the vSphere Client SDK.

##Intended Audience
This information is intended for anyone who wants to extend the vSphere Client with custom functionality in vSphere 6.7. Users typically are software developers who use HTML and JavaScript to create graphical user interface components that work with VMware vSphereÂ®.
